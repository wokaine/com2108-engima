# com2108-enigma
Repository for the COM2108 programming assignment

## About
This project was done as part of the COM2018 "Functional Programming" module at The University of Sheffield. It was done in three parts:
- Part One: Encrypting and Decrypting a sentence using The Enigma Machine
- Part Two: Finding the longest "Menu" of an encrypted sentence.
- Part Three: Using the "Menu" to simulate "The Bombe" and decrypt the message.

Please be aware that part two doesn't function as it should and thus part three also doesn't work properly. Part one is working completely fine however.
